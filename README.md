# Employee-Tracker-App#

## Description

My goal for this project was to develop a tool for companies to keep track of their employees, departments, and positions more easily.  I was able to create relationships between different tables and use mySQL to seed the data necessary into the appropriate tables.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

The first step is to clone the repository onto your local machine and open up the integrated terminal on the 'db' folder. In the command window you will type 'mysql -u root -p' and be prompted to enter your password.  Once in mysql you will run the following commands: 'source schema.sql' & 'source seeds.sql' to initialize and populated the database.

Once those are done you will quit mysql by typing 'quit' and path back into the main directory.  You will run 'npm -i' to install the necessary dependencies for the project to function.

## Usage

To use the application all you need to do is follow the installation instructions, open your server.js integrated termainal, and run 'npm start' to begin the prompt window.  Attached is a video to show the usage of the application in entirety.
